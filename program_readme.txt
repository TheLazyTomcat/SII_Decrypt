Description
------------------------------
This program is designed to decrypt and/or decode SII files that are used as a
mean of storing save data in truck games developed by SCS Software. It was
successfully tested on saves from Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck
Simulator and therefore should work for those games.
Unlike in previous version, you do not need to change save format the game is
using. Current version of this program can understand the now used binary format
and will convert it to a human readable textual form. However, as the binary
format specification is not public, the decoding cannot be fully tested and
therefore might not work in rare circumstances or in future games. If that
happens, you can disable it by command no_decode (but in that case, you have to
configure the game to again store the saves in textual form).
The program can also decode 3nK-encoded SII files used for example in
localization.



Use of the program
------------------------------
Using the GUI program should be simple enough. Just run it and use provided
controls (buttons, edits, ...) to select input and output files, set processing
settings and so on.

To use command line utility, run it with proper command line parameters.
For normal user not familiar with command line, it simple means dropping file
that has to be decrypted on the utility icon.
More advanced user can use one of two available parameter schemes - simple and
extended.

Simple scheme

    SII_Decrypt.exe InputFile [OutputFile]

  There are no commands available in the simple scheme. Program just takes first
  parameter as input file path and second parameter, if present, as an output
  file path. If output path is not specified, the result is stored back into
  input file.

Extended scheme

    SII_Decrypt.exe [commands] -i InputFile [-o OutputFile]

  Extended scheme allows you to use commands when invoking the utility. Output
  file is optional and when not specified, the result is stored back into input
  file.

  Available commands are:

    --no_decode     When present, the program will not attempt to decode the
                    file, only decryption will be done. Can be used when there
                    are problems with the decoding.

    --dec_unsupp    Enables experimental decoding of unsupported types when the
                    decoding is attempted. As the implementation cannot be
                    checked in any way, use of this option is dangerous (might
                    damage saves) and you will be using it at your own risk.

    --sw_aes        AES decryption will be done completely in software.
                    Normally, AES can use hardware acceleration when supported
                    by hardware, this command disables it.

    --on_file       All processing will be done directly on the file. When not
                    present, entire file is loaded into memory and processed
                    there, this command can therefore lower memory use (but not
                    by a much).

    --wait          Program will not close the console when processing is done
                    and will wait for user input. Can be used when you want to
                    see possible error code.

Known problems and limitations
----------------------------------------
As mentioned before, decoding might not be 100% reliable. In case of
problems, contact author or run the tool with command no_decode.
