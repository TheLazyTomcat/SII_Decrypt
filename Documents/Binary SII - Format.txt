                                 >> WARNING <<<

This document does not describe complete process of conversion from binary SII
file into its textual form. It merely describes the file format.
Binary SII format is not officially documented, so every information provided
here is only an educated gues and comes from observation of data patterns.
Nomenclature is also completely arbitrary and should not be referenced as being
official (or even right).

================================================================================

Notes on basic types:

  - all binary values are stored with little endianness
  - floating point numbers are conformant with IEEE 754
  - strings seems to have UTF8 encoding, char is 8bit wide, they are NOT
    null-terminated
  - vectors, arrays and other structured types do not have any padding or
    alignment, be it explicit or implicit
  - all strings and arrays are stored as a pair of 32bit (unsigned) length
    followed by an actual array of items/characters, empty arrays are stored
    only as a length of zero


General file structure
----------------------------------------
Binary SII files are a serialization of structures the game uses internally,
but they are not just plain dump of the memory.
Each file starts with an 8byte header, followed by one or more blocks.
Currently, only two kind of blocks are recognized - layout block and data block.
Layout block defines structure of one or more data blocks - so it denotes how
the data block should be read and parsed. To this moment, all examined files had
all layout blocks at the beginning (before any data block), followed by a stream
of data blocks. But in theory, layout block might appear anywhere in the file,
only necessary rule is that layout block must precede data block whose structure
it defines.
Stream of blocks is terminated by an invalid layout block (see further).


Header
----------------------------------------
Structure of the header:

  begin
    UInt32 (4B)   - file signature, 0x49495342 ("BSII" when read as text)
    UInt32 (4B)   - version of format used in the file
                    (must be 2 for current implementation)
  end

WARNING - This documentation and also the decoder are both written only for
          format version 2! There are other versions around, but they differ in
          details and current decoder cannot work with them. I was not able to
          obtain sufficient data to reverse-engineer those versions.


Blocks
----------------------------------------
Every block has this structure:

  begin
    UInt32 (4B)             - block type
    []     (variable size)  - payload
  end

If block type is zero, the block is considered to be a layout block.
When it is any other number, it is considered to be a data block of structure
given by this number (see further for details).


Layout block
----------------------------------------
Layout block is denoted by a block type of 0.
Payload of the layout block consists of an 8bit value whose use is currently
unknown, layout ID, layout name and an array of value type and value name
pairs. This array is terminated by a value type of zero (NOT followed by a value
name).
When the unknown 8bit value is zero, the block is considered to be invalid and
marks end of the file.
Layout ID must not be 0 and must be unique (ID equal to 0 or non-unique ID is
treated as an error).

Structure of payload:

  begin
    UInt8   (1B)            - unknown value
    UInt32  (4B)            - layout ID
    String  (variable size) - layout name
    array of ...
    begin
      UInt32  (4B)            - value type
      String  (variable size) - value name
    end
    UInt32  (4B)            - invalid value type (0)
  end

Layout ID is used to identify actual structure of any data block.
Layout name is just an identifier, no deeper meaning is known at this moment.
Value type number marks type of the stored data (integer, string, array, ...).
You can find description of individual types in a file "Binary SII - Types.txt".
Value name is a string identifier of the field. It is used in textual form of
SII files as an identifier.


Data block
----------------------------------------
Data block is denoted by a block type other than 0.
Payload of the data block consists of block ID (which is a complex structure -
for details see documentation of types) and a stream of data fields. Individual
fields are not separated by any padding or any other data.
Number and type of individual fields is given by actual block type. You take
block type number and find a layout block that has the same layout ID as is this
number. This layout block then defines these fields (items in an array of value
type and name pairs).


Example BSII file
----------------------------------------
Let's have the following binary SII file (here shown as a hex stream):

  42 53 49 49  02 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  01 01 00 00  00 0F 00 00  00 66 69 72

  32 5F 66 69  65 6C 64 36  00 00 00 14  00 00 00 62  79 74 65 62  6F 6F 6C 5F

  FF F8 F9 FA  FB FC FD FE  FF 00 00 80  3F 00 00 00  00 00

When converted into textual form, it looks like this:

SiiNunit
{
first_structure : _nameless.807.0605.0403.0201 {
 int32_field: -1
 bytebool_array_field: 3
 bytebool_array_field[0]: false
 bytebool_array_field[1]: true
 bytebool_array_field[2]: false
 empty_uint64_array_field: 0
}

last : _nameless.fffe.fdfc.fbfa.f9f8 {
 single_field: 1
}

}
